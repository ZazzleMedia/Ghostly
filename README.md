Ghostly
=======

A framework that doesn't appear to be there! Ghostly is a css framework that is made to be as transparent as possible,
It works by apply styles through mixins that way when compiled only what you actually uses is compiled into the final stylesheet
the obviosuly benefits of this is that you get the power of a css framework and the quickness to prototype layouts without
the actual bloat of an entire css framework becuase, only what you use is what you get.
