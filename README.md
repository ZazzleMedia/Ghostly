Ghostly
=======

A framework that doesn't appear to be there! Ghostly is a css framework that is made to be as transparent as possible,
It works by appling styles through mixins that way when you compile it, only what you actually use is compiled into the final stylesheet.
The obvios benefits of this is that you get the power of a css framework and the quickness to prototype layouts without
the actual bloat of an entire css framework.
